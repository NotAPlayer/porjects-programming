<h1>Music: Music saves lives</h1>
<body>
    <h2>Why I love music?</h2>
    <p>First off, why not? being exposed to music at an early age is the best that could ever happen to a person. I love music because it can save me from being sad, it can save me from boredom, and with my talents that I have in music, I even can produce music. In every music that I composed, in every rhythm that I do with instruments, it changes my mood. Another thing is that I love music because my father was also into music, I used music same with my father in church. Music has taught me that, even though there were friends to talk to problem, by simply do music can also be your listener. THAT'S WHY MUSIC CAN SAVE LIVES</p>
