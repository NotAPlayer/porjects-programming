  This is pretty hard for me as I still get confused on how to use the display flex, although I can use some way to center the boxes by editing the margin. Centering the flex boxes really are the most hardest I encountered, I even communicate with my co-interns and asked them what they do
and pretty much we had same thinking of use margin instead, that's why instead of using the align properties, I eidted the margin until I get the desired location of the element.






took me 3 hours and a half
